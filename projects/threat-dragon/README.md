We are very grateful to the talented artist [DЯΣΛMƧVΣЯƧΣ](https://linktr.ee/dreamsverse) who created the artwork for Cupcake,
the Threat Dragon logo.

DЯΣΛMƧVΣЯƧΣ has allowed use of the [original artwork](https://www.deviantart.com/thelonelyqueen/art/HW-Lil-Baby-Dragon-Lineart-300502156)
on condition that it used only for 'not for profit' purposes - perfect for the OWASP open source project.

Cupcake has a birthday as well: DЯΣΛMƧVΣЯƧΣ uploaded the original artwork on 7th May 2012.
